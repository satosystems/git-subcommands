# Git sub commands

This repository provides Git style CLI sub commands these are very helpful, I think.

## Quickstart

Clone the Git repository, and step inside.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/satosystems/git-subcommands.git
...
$ cd git-subcommands
$
```

Run the `make install` to install to your system environment.

```shell-session
$ make install
...
$
```

The program is installed at `/usr/local/bin`, and the manual is installed at `/usr/local/share/man`.
